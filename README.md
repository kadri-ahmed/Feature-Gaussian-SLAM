# Feature Gaussian SLAM
Building upon the works of SplaTAM (SLAM w/ Gaussian Splatting) and
OpenGaussian (Open Vocabulary Scene Understanding), we are improving the SLAM pipeline in-
tractivity by incorporating 3D instance level understanding to get a deeper and better understand-
ing of the environment during the exploration.
